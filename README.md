Chat/Messaging app that allows for anonymous live chatting with operators at both CTS Help Desk & other campus services to respond to work requests (an alternative to phone calls). This is beneficial as often, tickets/calls could be solved with a simple chat message rather than a call. Furthermore, an operator could respond to multiple messages at the same time thus streamlining the process. Any case that is unable to be handled by a message can be written up as a ticket to be pushed down the line.
